;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides magit integration for pre-commit, the framework
;; for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Run pre-commit on staged files or all files
;; - Run specific hooks with completion
;; - Install and update pre-commit hooks
;; - Status section showing running/failed hooks
;;
;; The integration auto-activates when both conditions are met:
;; - The `pre-commit' executable is available in PATH
;; - A `.pre-commit-config.yaml' file exists in the project root
